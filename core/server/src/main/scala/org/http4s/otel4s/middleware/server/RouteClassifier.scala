  * @note This trait is used to provide the value for the `http.route`
  *       `Attribute`, which is the path template relative to the application
  *       root. If the application's routes are written as a `PartialFunction`,
  *       then the precise format of the path template is up to the implementer
  *       to decide. However, if a library with its own format is used to
  *       generate the `PartialFunction`, then that library's format should be
  *       used. The values returned by an implementation should have low
  *       cardinality. See
  *       [[https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-spans/#http-server]]
  *       for more information. The value of the `http.route` `Attribute` is
  *       also used as part of the span name.
